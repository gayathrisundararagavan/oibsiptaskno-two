        <!-- <figcaption>Gandhi changed the world in many ways. One way was he won over India's independence from the British. Gandhi won independence for India by using his non-violent methods. He showed the world that using violence was wrong. India loves Gandhi for giving them their freedom and independence. One more thing that Gandhi did was tell everyone to stand up for their own rights and to also to fight against cruelty. Later on Martin Luther King Jr. used Gandhi's non-violent methods and he won civil rights for African Americans. Using non-violence may be the best way to fight!
